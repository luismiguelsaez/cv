Resume: |
  As a vocational Unix/Linux sysadmin, I enjoy exploring and testing new technologies and trends, as I think that this makes me better in my work, and this is also my hobby.
  I have a lot of experience administering most popular Linux distros, like RHEL/CentOS, Ubuntu, etc. in high-availability production and critical environments.
  Some years ago, I started learning and testing some DevOps tools and metodologies, and deploying/migrating services to cloud, like AWS; and now, I am working with AWS cloud, and automating everything through Terraform, Vagrant, Ansible, Docker, Jenkins, etc.
  My personal "soft" skills are flexibility and capacity to learn new technologies, persistence while solving problems and a great curiosity for every new technology I know about.
